				<p>For last several decades the world economy has been experiencing a massive shift from agriculture and production to services and further to creative sector of economy as it was noted by Richard Florida, the head of Martin Prosperity Institute, Canada. Modern technologies disrupt economy in such a way that more and more people are left unemployed and the earlier perceived as insane was the idea of unconditional basic income is already being implemented in advanced countries. Very soon our society will face the momentum when routine physical and even mental human labor is not required anymore for advancement. Here comes the question – what the hell will people do?</p>

<p>MDL Talent Hub will probably not save the world, but certainly the platform will make it brighter. One of the fundamental features of the project is that it will create jobs and give some meaning to the participants’ life. Isn’t it nice when people can find a paying audience for their talents and monetize their time spent on hobbies? MDL will make it easier!</p>

<p>Brave New World is already part of our reality and people consciously or unconsciously admit it and regret having dropped their hobbies and now push their own children to learn to be more artistic. MDL Talent Hub is conceptually what should happen sooner or later and we are happy to be the facilitators.</p>

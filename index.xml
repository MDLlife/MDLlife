      <description>MDL Talent Hub platform will be powered with MDL Token Hours (MDL TH). MDL TH will be used to support MDL Token value growth as well as to protect the platform from high MDL Token volatility. Below are 8 statements that describe MDL TH concept.
 The mechanism of MDL Token Hours has been adapted from Skycoin Coin Hours. The amount of MDL Tokens Hours received increases according to how many MDL Tokens are held.</description>

      <title>Why the value of MDL Token will increase over time</title>
      <link>http://mdl.life/2018-01-14-why-mdl-value-increase/</link>

      <guid>http://mdl.life/2018-01-14-why-mdl-value-increase/</guid>
      <description>For our early investors it is crucial to know why MDL tokens will increase in value over time. We have just realized that what was obvious to us is not that clear to the community. Here we briefly explain our plans about the usage of the Token and how we guarantee its growth for our crypto investors.
First of all, the value of the MDL token will increase from our expansion in the talent sourcing market, which is itself continually growing.</description>

      <description>One of our missions is to bring transparency to the talent sourcing market, however we also need to cope with the commonly accepted processes and settings in this area. Use of blockchain and Persistent Immutable Data Storage (PIDS) - IPFS, CXO - technologies that are known for their ability to make data open, traceable, and immutable raises a good question – what kind of information will be open to the public?</description>

      <description>Given the current state of global blockchain development, it seems that most people have totally forgotten that behind every project there are actual people working [or not]. So a stylish website with a promising, geeky video, featuring Bitcoin or Ethereum addresses, gets people more attracted to invest than a hardworking community with respect-worthy leaders. People just send money blindly to a smart contract, without researching who&amp;rsquo;s working on the concept, code, marketing, etc.</description>

      <description>What we are doing and why?
In the ongoing blockchain mania there are so many projects that seem to be less than genuine or even fake. ICOs have become not only a tool for startups to raise funds, but also for scammers looking to make a quick buck. Is MDL Talent Hub a real project with a well thought out vision and development plan, or it is just riding the wave of cryptohype?</description>

      <description>MDL Talent Hub will utilize PIDS technologies (IPFS, CXO, etc), which will allow information to be stored in a distributed manner on users’ devices and miners, improving access, speed, and security of information.
In order to compensate our users and miners we will establish a bounty program by which anyone can get a certain number of MDL Tokens for storing info about talents, events, and so forth. MDL Tokens can then be spent on MDL Talent Hub for other valuables or exchanged to other crypto or fiat currency.</description>

      <description>For the last several decades the world&amp;rsquo;s economy has been experiencing a massive shift from agriculture and production based to services and creative based, as noted by Richard Florida, the head of the Martin Prosperity Institute, Canada. Modern technologies disrupt the economy in such a way that more and more people will be left unemployed. The change is so momentous that ideas which were previously considered insane such as that of unconditional basic income are already being implemented in advanced countries.</description>

      <description>캐나다 마틴번영연구소(Martin Prosperity Institute)의 리처드 플로리다(Richard Florida) 소장도 주목한 바 있듯이, 지난 수십년간 세계 경제는 농업 및 생산 경제에서 서비스 경제, 나아가서는 창조 경제로 대대적인 이동을 경험하고 있습니다. 현대 기술은 점점 더 많은 사람들을 실업자로 전락시켜 경제가 어려워지고 있으며, 이전에는 미친 소리로 치부되었던 &amp;ldquo;조건없는 기본 소득&amp;rdquo;의 개념도 선진국에서는 이미 시행되고 있는 상황입니다. 머지 않아 우리 사회는 발전을 위해서 더 이상 사람의 일상적 정신 활동, 심지어는 육체 활동마저도 필요하지 않을 순간을 마주하게 될 것입니다.</description>

      <title>How MDL secures reputation</title>
      <link>http://mdl.life/2017-12-05-how-mdl-secures-reputation/</link>

      <guid>http://mdl.life/2017-12-05-how-mdl-secures-reputation/</guid>
      <description>In order to facilitate the credibility of reputation MDL Talent Hub will employ two modern technologies – blockchain and PIDS. Let us explain in a simple manner how it will work.
Persistent Immutable Data Storage (PIDS) is a new way to keep information. The technology allows storage of data on devices of users instead of using centralized servers which are vulnerable to attack. Nowadays there are two promising protocols being developed and already available for usage – IPFS and CXO; both promise to substantially reduce costs and increase the speed of transmission.</description>

      <description>평판의 신뢰성을 확보하기 위해 MDL 탤런트 허브(Talent Hub)는 두 가지 최신 기술을 채택하는데, 블록체인과 PIDS가 바로 그것입니다. 이 기술들이 어떻게 작동하는지 간단하게 설명드리겠습니다.
PIDS(Persistent Immutable Data Storage 지속성 변형불가 데이터 저장)는 새로운 형태의 데이터 저장 방식입니다. 이 기술은 중앙집중식의, 공격에 취약한 서버를 사용하지 않고 각 사용자 장치에 데이터를 저장합니다. 최근, 그 미래가 아주 밝은 두 가지 새로운 프로토콜이 개발되고 있으며 이미 사용가능한 단계에 이르고 있는데, IPFS와 CXO가 바로 그것입니다. 이 두 가지 프로토콜은 전송 비용의 대폭적인 감소와 전송 속도의 상당한 향상을 동시에 보장합니다.</description>

      <description>Since South Korea is actively promoting the startup ecosystem and innovations to survive the fierce technological competition in Asia, the Korean government has initiated a program of annual startup festivals, and last week was the first successful trial. It was a gathering of entrepreneurs, tech media, and VCs all under one roof of the COEX complex in Seoul.
MDL Talent Hub was kindly invited to participate in the event and was lucky enough to gain some excellent exposure since the problems the project is aiming to solve exist in Korea as well.</description>

      <description>한국은 아시아의 치열한 기술 경쟁에서 이기기 위해 스타트업 생태계와 혁신을 적극 권장하고 있습니다. 그 일환으로 한국 정부는 매년 개최될 스타트업 페스티발 프로그램을 구상하였고, 드디어 지난 주, 서울 코엑스의 한 지붕 아래 기업가, 첨단기술 언론매체, 창업투자사 등이 함께 모이는 첫번째 시도를 성공적으로 치루어냈습니다.
MDL 탤런트 허브(Talent Hub)는 이번 행사에 참가 초청을 받아 그 존재감을 훌륭하게 발휘할 수 있었습니다. MDL팀의 그런 활약이 가능했던 이유는 바로 MDL이 해결하고자 하는 문제점들이 한국에도 존재하고 있기 때문이었습니다.</description>

      <description>In order to keep our financial flows positive we are considering the following methods of revenue creation. Innovative streams are enabled by the use of blockchain technology.
Traditional Streams
1.Extended functionality
Paid features will provide extended functionality for users of our platform. Extended functionality will allow bookers to be more knowledgeable and talents to be more presentable and thus it will give them both advantages on the market.
2.Commission from transactions</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;If I had an hour to solve a problem I&amp;rsquo;d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.&amp;rsquo; - Albert Einstein
 That especially applies to constantly evolving talent market that requires nonstop monitoring and analysis in order to be aware of constantly evolving issues. In addition, because solutions are not easy to develop, certain complications simply remain ignored. Thus not only identifying existing issues, but also foreseeing upcoming ones and taking preventive measures is necessary to allow one to be on the top of things.</description>

      <description>The first public appearance of MDL was on the 12th of October 2017 at Slush Conference. We presented our vision and ideas to several experienced VC investors and high-tech businessmen and not only got positive feedback and encouragement, but also received some valuable advice.
Excellent ideas cannot flourish in a closed off ecosystem, so sharing thinking and knowledge is absolutely important for survival and development in the modern world. It is said that social capital is much more important than any physical asset, so we were very happy to grow up our network by acquiring new valuable connections as well as strengthen our ties with old friends.</description>

It looks like the event that took place on the 8th of October had pretty good chances to occur. All the puzzle pieces were collected in one place. It was a tiny step forward towards a great venture that is going to affect our society, and even more, the lives of its direct stakeholders.</description>

      <description>The majority of Asian countries, including China and Indonesia, have already for the past several years been enthusiastically transforming their economies from export-driven to consumption-driven. Accordingly, the advertisement industry is expected to continue to show double digit growth. Taking into consideration collectivistic patterns of Asian cultures we can observe overwhelming involvement of talents in all marketing activities. No matter whether it is online, onscreen, or onsite promotion, talents are always a key element of advertising and promotional activities.</description>

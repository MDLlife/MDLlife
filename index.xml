      <title>What Do We Do and Why</title>

      <description>What we are doing and why?
In the ongoing blockchain mania there are so many projects that seem to be less genuine or even fake. ICO became an easy tool for startups to raise funds and so scammers are up for a long buck as well. Is MDL Talent Hub a real thing with solid vision and development plan or it is just riding a wave of cryptohype? We believe we stand on the solid ground and here is why.</description>

      <description>MDL Talent Hub will utilize PIDS technologies (IPFS, CXO, etc), which will allow information to be stored in a distributed manner on users’ devices and miners, raising access, speed, and security of information much higher.
In order to compensate our users and miners we will establish bounty program by which anyone can get a certain number of MDL Tokens for storing info about talents, events, and so forth. Received in such a way, MDL Tokens can be spent on MDL Talent Hub for other valuables or exchanged to other crypto or fiat currency.</description>

      <description>Profile We believe that a talented person can be talented in many ways, so each profile will have several portfolios – actor, dancer, origami master, or whatever. Each of the portfolios will have sufficient presentation materials like compcard, intro videos, or else. Thus a booker can easily choose certain portfolio from a talent, which is required for the certain event.
Search Search will be available both for bookers and talents in terms that it will be possible to look for jobs as well as for freelancers.</description>

      <description>For last several decades the world economy has been experiencing a massive shift from agriculture and production to services and further to creative sector of economy as it was noted by Richard Florida, the head of Martin Prosperity Institute, Canada. Modern technologies disrupt economy in such a way that more and more people are left unemployed and the earlier perceived as insane was the idea of unconditional basic income is already being implemented in advanced countries.</description>

      <title>How MDL secures reputation</title>

      <description>In order to facilitate credibility of reputation MDL Talent Hub will employ two modern technologies – blockchain and PIDS. Let us explain in a simple manner how it will work.
Persistent Immutable Data Storage (PIDS) is a new way to keep information. The technology allows storage of data on devices of users instead of using centralized and viable to attacks servers. Nowadays there are two promising protocols being developed and already available for usage – IPFS and CXO; both promise substantially reduce cost and increase speed of transmission.</description>

      <description>In order to keep our financial flows positive we are considering the following methods of revenue creation. Innovative streams are enabled due to the use of blockchain technology.
Traditional Streams
1.Extended functionality
We will give a chance to be outstanding for our VIP participants. Extended functionality will allow bookers to be more knowledgeable and talents to be more presentable and thus it will make them both more active on the market.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;If I had an hour to solve a problem I&amp;rsquo;d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.&amp;rsquo; - Albert Einstein
 That barely applies to constantly evolving talent market that requires nonstop monitoring and analysis in order to be aware of constantly popping up issues. In addition, solutions are not coming immediately so that certain complications remain simply ignored. Thus not only identification of existing issues, but also foreseeing of upcoming ones and consequent implementation of preventive measures will allow one to be on the top of things.</description>

      <description>The first public appearance of MDL was on the 12th of October 2017 at Slush Conference. We have presented our vision and ideas to several experienced VC investors and high-tech businessman and not only got positive feedback and encouragement but also received some valuable advice.
Excellent ideas cannot appear in reserved ecosystem, so sharing thinking and knowledge is absolutely important for survival and development in modern world. It is said that social capital is much more important than any physical asset, so we were very happy to grow up our network by acquiring new valuable connections as well as strengthen our ties with old friends.</description>

      <description>Your browser does not support the video tag.  It is said that some events have less probability to happen and some more. It looks like the event that took place on the 8th of October had pretty good chances to appear. All the puzzle pieces were collected in one place. It was a tiny step of initiation towards a great venture that is going to affect our society and even much more the lives of its direct stakeholders who were three…</description>

      <description>As majority of Asian countries, including China and Indonesia, are already for several years enthusiastically transforming their economies from export-driven to consumption-driven, advertisement industry is continuing to show double digits growth. Taking into consideration collectivistic patterns of Asian cultures we can observe overwhelming involvement of talents in all marketing activities. No matter whether it is online, onscreen, or onsite promotion, talents are always the key part of it.
Thus, for an instance, China is experiencing a massive influx of foreign talents of all types – models and actors, singers and dancers, circus and theme parks performers, and all of them are considered premium here just because of their nationality.</description>

      <description>In order to keep our financial flows positive we are considering the following methods of revenue creation. Innovative streams are enabled due to the use of blockchain technology.
Traditional Streams
1.Extended functionality
We will give a chance to be outstanding for our VIP participants. Extended functionality will allow bookers to be more knowledgeable and talents to be more presentable and thus it will make them both more active on the market.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;If I had an hour to solve a problem I&amp;rsquo;d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.&amp;rsquo; - Albert Einstein
 That barely applies to constantly evolving talent market that requires nonstop monitoring and analysis in order to be aware of constantly popping up issues. In addition, solutions are not coming immediately so that certain complications remain simply ignored. Thus not only identification of existing issues, but also foreseeing of upcoming ones and consequent implementation of preventive measures will allow one to be on the top of things.</description>

      <description>The first public appearance of MDL was on the 12th of October 2017 at Slush Conference. We have presented our vision and ideas to several experienced VC investors and high-tech businessman and not only got positive feedback and encouragement but also received some valuable advice.
Excellent ideas cannot appear in reserved ecosystem, so sharing thinking and knowledge is absolutely important for survival and development in modern world. It is said that social capital is much more important than any physical asset, so we were very happy to grow up our network by acquiring new valuable connections as well as strengthen our ties with old friends.</description>

      <description>As majority of Asian countries, including China and Indonesia, are already for several years enthusiastically transforming their economies from export-driven to consumption-driven, advertisement industry is continuing to show double digits growth. Taking into consideration collectivistic patterns of Asian cultures we can observe overwhelming involvement of talents in all marketing activities. No matter whether it is online, onscreen, or onsite promotion, talents are always the key part of it.
Thus, for an instance, China is experiencing a massive influx of foreign talents of all types – models and actors, singers and dancers, circus and theme parks performers, and all of them are considered premium here just because of their nationality.</description>

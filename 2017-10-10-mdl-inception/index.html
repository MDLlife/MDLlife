<p>It is said that some events have less probability to happen and some more. It looks like the event that took place on the 8th of October had pretty good chances to appear. All the puzzle pieces were collected in one place. It was a tiny step of initiation towards a great venture that is going to affect our society and even much more the lives of its direct stakeholders who were three…</p>

<p>Three friends from former Russian capital of Saint-Petersburg living in Shanghai and working in different industries – IT, international trade, and TVC production. The only thing that they had in common besides their nationality is a sparkling spirit of undertaking. And that was enough to begin…</p>

<p>But cut the pathetic shit!</p>

<p>It was pretty straightforward – the idea to join blockchain tsunami that is going to flood every economy sector in the nearest future was well-weighted and we have determined ourselves to be the first in the market we know, which is foreign model/artists segment of event and production industries. We have agreed that the combination of IT and blockchain expertise, market understanding and experience, legal and tax know-how gives us sound competitive advantage and excellent opportunity to shake the market disruptively.</p>

<p>Few words about us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Roman Tronenko.</em></strong> Experienced Fullstack Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the internet industry. IPFS pioneer. Polyglot in all senses: Skilled in Golang, Python, C++, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, and eager to learn more. Strong engineering professional with two Master&rsquo;s degrees focused in Computer Science. The founder and initiator of the <a href="http://gogo.tattoo">gogo.tattoo</a> Project. If you had to do something with China, Mandarin language or languages in general, there&rsquo;s a very big chance you&rsquo;ve used one of the apps Roman built or was involved in.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dmitry Timokhin.</em></strong> Graduated from St. Petersburg State University, Russia he is living in Shanghai, PRC more than a decade. The area of expertise including but not limited to the apparel manufacturing, media publishing house, food and non-food import/export and distribution, biomedicine technologies and regenerative medicine. Dmitry runs a group of companies set in China, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Russia, which makes him able to handle any sort of tax and legal issues in Asia as well as be experienced enough in scaling strategies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dimitry Doronin.</em></strong> Being European educated he is actively developing his professional career in China for about 5 year. While pursuing his PhD degree in team management and team creativity he is actively involved in TVC production as a production coordinator and casting manager. Being a model on part-time basis himself on the top of that gives him excellent observation point to evaluate the overall talent industry in China and worldwide. Initiator and COO of F You Art Community and several other smaller media projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For each one of us this project is an important step forward within our careers and we all feel enthusiastic and prepared for the long-term sailing, for the storms and the calms that are going to happen on our way.</p>

<p>And we have started. Started to discuss, plan, learn, execute and have fun together.</p>

<p>MDL was the name.</p>

<p>And it has begun.</p>

In the very beginning of December MDL Team will join Startup Festival 2017 in Seoul, South Korea. SF2017 is organized for the first time by Korean government in order to facilitate innovation ecosystem in the country. There are will be around 60 chosen startups from Asia personally invited to meet VCs and media from around the world.  MDL is in the list!

It will be the first big event for us as a team and we are looking forward to give nice impression to our future potential partners as well as old friends that we will meet there.

In addition, we are glad to announce that our webpage mdl.life is launched now and we have this wonderful video to explain what we are actually aiming to do.

Enjoy!

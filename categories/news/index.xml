      <description>#TalkInAnElevatorDay Did you know that today marks “National Talk in an Elevator Day”? Yes, you read it right. And we bet you had no idea that there is such day. It takes place on the last Friday of July every year, carrying the premise to encourage people to break the silence and make the conversation with a stranger while riding in an elevator.
We all know and experienced that awkward silence during a routinely quiet vertical commute.</description>

      <description>About our YOYOW partnership In January 2018 MDL Talent Hub and YOYOW have concluded a strategic partnership agreement. The idea behind it is to integrate the MDL platform into YOYOWs ecosystem. What does this mean?
First of all, let’s quickly go over YOYOW’s mission. The guys at YOYOW are basically bringing instruments for fair distribution of value creation in social media networks. In traditional social media users never receive any material rewards for the content they create, which is absolutely unfair!</description>
